# MC Issue Tracker
A repository dedicated to tracking issues on my mods/modpacks.

## Reporting an issue
I don't really care about the format, but it needs to be somewhat complehensible and contain logs (if applicable)

Please please please please please please please use the right tags for your issue it makes it much better to know where the bug came from!

## Feature requests
Feature requests are very welcome but make them somewhat realistic, I'm not making two whole mods in one.
